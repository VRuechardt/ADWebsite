	            That was the ambitious goal of 8 students of the CDTM who participated in the elective “Autonomous Drones”. The students with various backgrounds – from consumer affairs to computer science – learned within one week the basic concepts of Computer Vision and Object Recognition in order to autonomously compete in a final drone race.

	            The course was supported by excellent lecturers who provided the necessary know-how in Python, Computer Vision & Image Processing, and basics in Robotics. In a thought-provoking ethic session the students discussed the advantages and risks that come with the usage of autonomous drones. Each team developed a different approach to master an autonomous flight of their drone through a parkour of three small soccer gates. At the end of the weeks, the four teams competed in a final race.
